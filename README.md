    <h1>Introduction to IT - Assignment 1: My Profile</h1>
      <h2>Personal information</h2>
<p><ul>My name is Carissa Eleanor Imperial</ul></p>
<p><ul>My student number is s3971782</ul></p>
<p><ul>My student email is s3971782@student.rmit.edu.au</ul></p>
<p><ul>My nationality is Australian</ul></p>
<p><ul>My culture is Filipino</ul></p>
<p><ul>The highest level of education that I have completed is Year 12</ul></p>
<p><ul>I attended Carrington Primary School and Brentwood Secondary College for my education thus far</ul></p>
<p><ul>My language is English<ul></p>
<p>My hobbies include writing novels, fantasy worldbuilding (for my books!), bouldering (sometimes) drawing, making moodboards, participating in my favourite fandoms (such as making fanart, reading and writing fanfiction and coming up with theories), reading books and baking.</p>
<p>In addition, my favourite fandoms include Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Hannibal, The Poppy War, Ava’s Demon, Necropolis, the MCU, The Witcher, Oxenfree, Adventure Time, Inside Job, Star Wars, Merlin (the BBC show), Sherlock Holmes, Avatar: The Last Airbender (and Avatar: Legend of Korra, as well as the fan made comic Legend of Genji), Dragon Age, DC comics, and the Grishaverse.</p>
<p>Also, I used to be into video games, and I started off with Final Fantasy 13 part 2, and I used to play some XBOX and DS Nintendo games, but I got caught up with my other hobbies and I stopped playing games for a while. I intend to playing again in the future, though to be honest I am still very much a newbie when it comes to video games.</p>
<p>My favourite genre is fantasy, because I love how wild and imaginative creators can go with their worldbuilding, and it’s so fascinating to watch/read all of these human conflicts on such a fantastically epic scale. I’m also always on the hunt for new tv shows or movies to add to my watchlist, as well as books to add to my TBR pile.</p>
<p>The fandom things that I’m looking forward to in the future include watching the House of the Dragon, because unlike ASOIAF, it’s actually finished, so it sounds very interesting; watching the Sandman, because following the awaken god of dreams as a protagonist sounds like such a fascinating concept; finally watching the Harley Quinn HBO animated show; the Six of Crows TV show spinoff; the School for Good and Evil Netflix movies, and the Lockwood and Co. Netflix show, since those books were my childhood.</p>
<p>The other goals/things that I’m looking forward to includes completing this degree, and the Master of business information systems degree (with a specialisation in library science); getting a job as a university librarian; finishing writing my books and potentially publishing them; and last, and most importantly, the COVID pandemic being over!</p>
