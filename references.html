<p class="regular-text"><strong>I have included two links for each website (only the link below each respective reference works, for going to the website referenced via clicking on it) in order to maintain the Harvard-style referencing and HTML link ettiquette. The url link was kept because the Harvard referencing rule for website/webpages is to include the URL at the end of each reference - but the URL does not work unless you copy and paste the link. The HTML link was kept because HTML requires links to be written that way in order for the user to be able to go to the webpage immediately after clicking on it.</strong></p>
