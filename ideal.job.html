<h1 class="second-subheading"><strong>Ideal job<strong></h1>

<p>My ideal job would be an associate university librarian, because I love helping other people, learning, and books. This position also contains the main aspects that I aim to have in a job, which are: a sense of purpose and meaningful contribution to society, as I would be helping students and teachers with their learning; being a part of the education and academia sector, because I love learning new things; and that it has a salary that would enable me to become financially independent.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the associate university librarian position would not be available immediately after the completion of my master’s degree (as it is a more senior role), I would like to be a university librarian in order to build up the experience required for that role.</p>
<p>In addition, I want to be a university librarian, so I can financially support myself while I pursue my aspirations of writing and publishing my own books, because only 2% of all authors are able to actually make a career writing their own books, so the odds are even lower for writers beginning their careers. Additionally, the salary of an author is not stable (dependent on the popularity of their books), thus meaning being an author while not doing a second job, is not financially secure. Hence, I am choosing the pathway of being a university librarian because it is still related to things I like, such as helping others, books, and learning, and also because I have heard that it provides a great work-life balance.</p>

In total, my tertiary education plan to attain the ALIA accreditations to become a librarian would take 4.5 years.</p>
